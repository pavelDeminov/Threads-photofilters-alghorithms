\b Task 1 (Streams)
\b0 \
\
Table contains data about people. Each cell in the table contains data for one person, cells can be repeated (i.e., several cells contain data about one person). When user clicks on the switcher the procedure starts replacing data in a randomly selected cell. The procedure is performed in a separated stream, the main stream should not be blocked and the table should be scrolled without delay.\
\

\b Task 2 (Photo filter)
\b0 \
\
The application edits image using the filter. You must implement image selection from the photo gallery, as well as there is ability to save the filtered image. It is forbidden to use open source libraries.\
\

\b Task 3 (Algorithms)
\b0 \
\
1) Solve the task in two ways (simple and fast): create a function that returns the number of zero bits in the symbols of the line (not to mention the null symbol in the end of line): intCountZeroBits (constchar *s) \
2) It is given an array of integers of N size that takes any value in the range from 1 to M, along with this one number in the array is repeated twice. Need to find this number in O (N).\
